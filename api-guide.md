# API Best Practices for Creating Agent APIs using FastAPI

This guide provides best practices for creating Agent APIs using FastAPI.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Environment Variables

Store sensitive information and configuration settings in environment variables. Use a `.env` file and load it using `dotenv`.

### 2. Organize Code into Modules

Organize your code into modules such as `schema`, `service`, and `settings` to keep the project structure clean and maintainable.

- **Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for your data, often using a data validation module such as Pydantic.
- **Service**: Contains the business logic and operations that interact with the data, typically through functions or classes.
- **Settings**: Holds configuration values and environment-specific settings, such as API keys and database URLs.

### 3. Use Dependency Injection

Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to manage dependencies such as the SQL agent. This makes your code more modular and testable.

### 4. Handle Exceptions Gracefully

Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the client. This improves the user experience and helps in debugging.

### 5. Use Async Programming

Leverage async programming to handle I/O-bound operations efficiently. Use async context managers and async functions where appropriate to improve performance.

### 6. Enable CORS

Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow your API to be accessed from different origins. This is essential for web applications that interact with your API.

### 7. Document Your API

Use Pydantic models to define request and response schemas. This helps in generating API documentation automatically, making it easier for developers to understand and use your API.

### 8. Use Logging

Use logging to capture important events and errors. This helps in debugging and monitoring the application. Ensure that logs are stored in a centralized location for easy access.

### 9. Monitor and Scale

Monitor your Agent API for performance and errors. Use tools like Application Insights and Azure Monitor in Azure AI Foundry to trace every agent run and track metrics. Ensure that your API can scale to handle increased traffic by using cloud services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### 10. Secure Your API

Use Azure authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your API endpoints. Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed. Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

By following these best practices, you can create robust and maintainable Agent APIs using FastAPI.
